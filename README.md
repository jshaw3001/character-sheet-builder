Generic Tabletop RPG Character Sheet Builder and Viewer!

Very basic character sheet builder/viewer software using Tkinter UI. Character data is stored as a generated .json file in a generated "characters" directory in the same directory as main.py. All game-related aspects (classes, ability scores, dice rolling) are intended to be non-specific and generic with zero balance or real use case.

Work in progress!

To-Do:
- Complete sheet viewer UI that parses json data and displays a complete character sheet with functioning buttons for simulated dice-rolling within the UI.
- Test project on another machine to figure out install/run requirements for third party usage.
