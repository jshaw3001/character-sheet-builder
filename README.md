Generic Tabletop RPG Character Sheet Builder and Viewer!

Very basic character sheet builder/viewer software using Tkinter UI. 
Character data is stored as a generated .json file in the "characters" directory in the same directory as main.py.
Sheet view has a dropdown that generates a list of characters by Name and (Class) from the json files in the "characters" directory.
When a character is selected from the dropdown the sheet is generated, including basic information, skills, and functioning roll buttons that print to a pseudo-terminal.
All game-related aspects (classes, ability scores, dice rolling) are intended to be non-specific and generic with zero balance or real use case.

To run, install requirements from requirements.txt and run main.py with no arguments.
